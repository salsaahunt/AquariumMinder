Aquarium Control system using Raspberry pi and Uno R3

This controller is a combination of various projects that have been posted.  Anywhere I have used someone elses code, I will make sure that they are acknowledged.

The plan is to have the Raspberry pi control the Uno R3 unit and the Uno to control equipment such as the relays and sensors.  This information will then be sent back to the RP for collection and graphical display.
